# Test Assignment: BFS Algorithm Implementation

This is a Flutter-based web application created as a test assignment. It demonstrates the implementation of the BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm for finding the shortest path.

## üåü Features

Algorithm Visualization
The app visually demonstrates the BFS algorithm's functionality for finding the shortest path in a grid or graph.
API Integration
Fetches tasks and sends results to an API endpoint for processing.
Flutter Web Deployment
Fully deployed on GitHub Pages for web access.

## üåê Live Demo

You can test the app here:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

For the app to function properly, the server that provides the API must include the following CORS header in its responses:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Without this header, the application will encounter CORS-related issues, and requests to the API will fail.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the App Locally

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/test-assignment.git

## üíª Technologies Used

Flutter
A powerful framework for building cross-platform applications.
Used to create the user interface, manage state, and implement business logic.
Dart
A programming language optimized for building mobile, desktop, and web applications.
Used for writing algorithms, managing application logic, and interacting with APIs.
BLoC (Business Logic Component)
A state management architecture that separates UI from business logic.
Implemented using the flutter_bloc package to handle states and events (e.g., UrlBloc for URL validation and ProgressBloc for BFS algorithm progress).
HTTP Package
Used to perform RESTful API requests (GET/POST) for backend communication.
Equatable
Simplifies object comparisons, ensuring efficient state updates in the BLoC architecture.
Flutter Web
Enables the app to run in web browsers and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
GitHub Pages
A static web hosting platform used to deploy the web version of the app.

BFS Algorithm
Implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.
The algorithm is integrated with the app‚Äôs logic and visualized in the user interface.
## üîó API Requirements

The application communicates with an API for task fetching and result submission. The API must:

**Support CORS for web requests.**
**Respond with structured JSON data.**
